    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
    <p>
        Idli is a soft, pillowy steamed savory cake made from fermented rice and lentil batter. The lentils used in making the idli batter are urad dal (hulled black gram).
        Black gram is also known as matpe beans, urad beans. To make idli the off white colored husked/hulled black gram is used it can be split or whole.
        The lentils and rice are soaked first and then later ground separately. The batters are mixed together and seasoned with salt.

    <p>
        The batter is allowed to ferment until it increases in volume. Later the batter is steamed in a special and unique cookware traditionally used for making idli.
        Idli is a traditional breakfast made in every South Indian household including mine. Idli is popular not only in the whole of India but outside India too.
        It is naturally vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free and makes for one of the healthiest breakfast options served with Sambar and Coconut Chutney.
