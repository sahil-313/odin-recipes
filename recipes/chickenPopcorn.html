    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken popcorn are bite-sized tender and crisp chunks of chicken that have been seasoned, breaded and deep fried to perfection, until golden.
        Since the breaded tiny chunks resemble popcorn, they are named as Chicken Popcorn.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some are breaded and some are not but simply coated with flour, which creates a popcorn like structure with a crust.
        Each are seasoned differently for a unique flavor.

    <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 cups oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Beat eggs and lemon juice together in a separate bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 2 inches of oil in a large pot over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dredge chicken pieces in flour mixture; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl.
            Press into flour mixture again to coat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lower pieces of chicken carefully into hot oil in batches; fry until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes.
            Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces.
        </li>
